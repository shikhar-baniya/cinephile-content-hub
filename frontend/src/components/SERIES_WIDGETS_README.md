- **Level 4** (10+ episodes): Full blue (100% opacity)

## üé® SeriesStatsWidgets (Container)

**Purpose**: Combined container for both widgets with responsive grid layout.

### Usage

```tsx
import SeriesStatsWidgets from '@/components/SeriesStatsWidgets';

<SeriesStatsWidgets movies={movies} />
```

### Layout
- Responsive grid: 1 column (mobile), 2 columns (lg), 3 columns (xl)
- Auto-sizing rows (minimum 150px)
- 4px gap between widgets

---

## üîå Integration Example

### In Your Main Stats Dashboard

```tsx
import WatchTimeWidget from '@/components/WatchTimeWidget';
import SeriesStatsWidgets from '@/components/SeriesStatsWidgets';

function StatsDashboard({ movies }: { movies: Movie[] }) {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* Existing watch time widget */}
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
        <WatchTimeWidget movies={movies} />
      </div>

      {/* New series-specific widgets */}
      <SeriesStatsWidgets movies={movies} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Individual Widget Usage

If you want more control over layout:

```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <SeriesProgressWidget movies={movies} />
  <EpisodeActivityWidget />
  <WatchTimeWidget movies={movies} />
</div>
```

## üéØ Key Benefits

### Series Progress Widget
‚úÖ Solves the "count" problem - shows actual season progress instead of binary series count  
‚úÖ Visual progress bars make it easy to see how far you are  
‚úÖ Shows both current season AND overall series progress  
‚úÖ Perfect for binge watchers tracking multiple shows  

### Episode Activity Widget
‚úÖ GitHub-style visualization makes patterns immediately visible  
‚úÖ Streak tracking gamifies watching habits  
‚úÖ Identifies binge watching patterns (high-intensity days)  
‚úÖ Shows consistency and engagement over time

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Requirements

These widgets require the enhanced series tracking schema:

```sql
-- series_seasons table
CREATE TABLE series_seasons (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  series_id UUID REFERENCES movies(id),
  season_number INTEGER,
  season_name VARCHAR(100),
  episode_count INTEGER,
  episodes_watched INTEGER,
  status VARCHAR(50), -- 'watching', 'completed', etc.
  watch_date DATE,
  started_date DATE,
  ...
);

-- series_episodes table
CREATE TABLE series_episodes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  season_id UUID REFERENCES series_seasons(id),
  episode_number INTEGER,
  episode_name VARCHAR(255),
  watched BOOLEAN,
  watch_date DATE,  -- IMPORTANT for activity tracking
  duration_minutes INTEGER,
  ...
);
```

---

## üöÄ Performance Notes

- **SeriesProgressWidget**: Makes 1 API call per series in progress + episode fetches
- **EpisodeActivityWidget**: Makes 1 bulk fetch for all episodes, then processes locally
- Both widgets cache data until movies array changes
- Lazy loading: widgets only expand when user clicks

---

## üé® Styling Customization

Both widgets use Tailwind CSS and match the existing design system:

- `floating-card` class for consistent card styling
- Gradient overlays with primary theme colors
- Smooth transitions (500ms duration)
- Hover effects for interactivity
- Responsive text sizing

To customize colors, modify the gradient classes:
- Series Progress: `purple-500` ‚Üí change to your preferred color
- Episode Activity: `blue-500` ‚Üí change to your preferred color

---

## üìä Future Enhancements

Potential additions:

1. **Filter by timeframe** (last 30/60/90/365 days)
2. **Compare series** (side-by-side progress)
3. **Export activity data** (download as CSV)
4. **Series recommendations** based on watching patterns
5. **Collaborative watching** (friend comparison)
6. **Watch goals** (set targets for completion)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### SeriesProgressWidget shows "No series in progress"
- Check that you have series with `status='watching'` in `series_seasons` table
- Verify the `seriesId` matches entries in the `movies` table

### EpisodeActivityWidget shows all zeros
- Ensure `watch_date` is populated in `series_episodes` table
- Check that `watched=true` for episodes you've watched
- Verify date format is ISO string (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Widget doesn't expand
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify all required dependencies are installed
- Ensure parent container has sufficient space for expanded view
